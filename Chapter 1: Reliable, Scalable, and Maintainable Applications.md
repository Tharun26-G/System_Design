# Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

## Key Concepts

1. **Data-Intensive vs. Compute-Intensive**
   - **Data-Intensive**: The main issue is moving data around.
   - **Compute-Intensive**: The main issue is the amount of processing power needed.
     
    **Important things in Data-Intensive**
   - Databases
   - Caches
   - Indexes
   - Message streams
   - Batch Processing

2. **Reliability**
   - working correctly in any fault.
   - **Faults vs. Failures**: A fault is a problem in the system; a failure is when the system stops working properly.
   - **Types of Faults**:
     - **Hardware Faults**: Fix with backup components.
     - **Software Errors**: Fix with good testing and self-healing systems.
     - **Human Errors**: Fix with good design, automation, training, and monitoring.

4. **Scalability**
   - System ability to cope with the increased load.
   - **Latency vs. Throughput**: Latency is the time it takes to handle one event; throughput is how many events are handled in a given time.
   - **Load Parameters**: Key factors that affect performance, like request rate and data volume.

6. **Maintainability**
   - **Operability**: How easy it is to run and maintain.
   - **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and fix.
   - **Evolvability**: Easy to change and update.

## Reliability Strategies
- **Redundancy**: Extra components for backup.
- **Replication**: Multiple copies of data.
- **Isolation**: Contain failures to prevent spreading.

## Scalability Techniques
- **Scaling Up**: More resources in one machine.
- **Scaling Out**: Spread load across many machines.
- **Load Balancing**: Evenly distribute requests.
- **Partitioning (Sharding)**: Split data into segments.

## Maintainability Practices
- **Automation**: Use scripts and automated deployments.
- **Monitoring**: Watch systems and get alerts for issues.
- **Code Quality**: Write clean, well-documented code.
- **Modular Design**: Break systems into smaller parts.

## Architectural Patterns
1. **Microservices**: Small, independent services.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Systems that respond to events.
3. **Batch Processing**: Process large amounts of data in chunks.
4. **Stream Processing**: Process data in real-time as it arrives.

## Summary

### Understanding Reliability
- **Types of Faults and Failures**: Hardware, software, and human errors.
- **Fault Tolerance Strategies**: Use replication, failover systems, and self-healing designs.

### Scalability Knowledge
- **Scaling Strategies**: Vertical (more power to one machine) and horizontal (more machines).
- **Trade-offs**: Consistency vs. availability, latency vs. throughput.
- **Load Balancing and Partitioning**: Spread load and manage data segments.

### Maintainability Insights
- **Operability**: Use automation and monitoring.
- **Simplicity**: Use modular design and write clean code.
- **Evolvability**: Decouple components and test thoroughly.

### Patterns and Practices
- **Microservices**: Flexible and independently deployable.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous processing.
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient for large data volumes.
- **Stream Processing**: Real-time data handling.
